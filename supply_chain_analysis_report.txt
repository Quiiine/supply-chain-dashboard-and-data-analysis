Supply Chain Analysis Report
----------------------------

This report is based on the data collected and processed from the supply chain simulation. The analysis includes various metrics
calculated to improve business processes and provide actionable insights.

Key Metrics:
------------
1. Total Orders: The total number of unique orders processed.
2. Average Cost: The average cost of each order.
3. Total Profit: Total revenue calculated based on a 20% profit margin from the cost of each order.
4. Max Delivery Time: The maximum delivery time recorded for any order.
5. Min Delivery Time: The minimum delivery time for an order.
6. Average Delivery Time: The average time it took to deliver orders.
7. Percent of Delayed Orders ( > 10 days): The percentage of orders where delivery exceeded 10 days, indicating possible bottlenecks.
8. Percent of Returned Orders: The percentage of orders marked as returned.
9. Percent of Damaged Orders: The percentage of orders marked as damaged.
10. Percent Over Target Delivery Time: The percentage of orders that exceeded the target delivery time (10 days).

Conclusions:
------------
- The average delivery time is acceptable for most orders; however, approximately X% of the orders faced delays.
- A significant percentage of orders were marked as returned or damaged, which indicates the need for improving product handling
  and logistics operations.
- Profitability is consistent, but the percentage of delayed and damaged orders negatively impacts the overall revenue and customer satisfaction.

Recommendations:
----------------
- Focus on optimizing the delivery process to minimize delays and reduce the percentage of orders taking longer than 10 days.
- Improve product handling processes to reduce the percentage of damaged goods and increase customer satisfaction.
- Implement real-time monitoring of these key metrics to quickly respond to issues in the supply chain, improving overall profitability.

This report was generated automatically using an Airflow DAG that simulates a supply chain business process and aggregates key metrics for further analysis.
